CHORUS: 
18 & over, I wants 2 bone ya (Yeah, baby) 
18 & over (Oh yeah, this is gonna be good) 
18 & over, I wants 2 bone ya (Yeah, baby) 
18 & over (Oh yeah, this is gonna be good) 

Now wait a minute 
This ain't nothin' but a little funky mack song 
All I'm sayin' is that I wanna smack it all night long 
On and on until the early morn' 
Givin' up all U need so U can get your groove on 
And as long as I got your attention (Yeah) 
There's a couple of new positions that I'd like 2 mention 
Did U ever hear the one about the pinwheel? (No) 
That's the one where I put your legs behind your head 
And real dirty like, I'ma spin U around 
And grab U by the waist and pump U till I hear my baby say ""Oww!"" 
That's what I know U like 
I'm your nigga now and I'm about 2 read your rights 
And as sure as I'm a nasty boy (What?) 
My girl, U know U got the right 2 make plenty noise (Oh!) 
Cuz this is your night and I'ma do U real good 
Just like a Kemo Sabe, Bone Ranger should 
Come 

18 & over, I wants 2 bone ya 
18 & over (Oh yeah, this is gonna be good) 
Come 
18 & over, I wants 2 bone ya 
18 & over (Oh yeah, this is gonna be good) 

And er ah... 
That's what we layin' 4 in the 9 5 
As long we know it's safe, we ain't riskin' no lives (Yeah) 
My doctor's name is Feelgood, makin' it so I do 
And if your name is ""Healthy"" then it's cool if me and U 
Just come - yeah baby, U should do all that 
Come - yeah baby 

(Oh yeah, this is gonna be good) 
18 & over, I wants 2 bone ya 
18 & over 

Hi-yo Silver, it's the Bone Ranger, I'll freak U 2 the marrow 
With a little somethin' that I call the wheelbarrow 
Walkin' up on your hands while I straddle your thighs 
In goes the truth and out goes the lie 
And before the beach gets 2 sandy (Uh oh) 
We'll call a wet towel, W.C. - it's Handy 
And it's all nice, comin' one, comin' twice 
And if the Johnny's slippery, we'll have 2 take the trip 2 Electricity 
And check out the sights (Check out the sights) 
And check out the sights 

When I blow that mind, baby (All night, alright) 
I'm gonna drive U crazy (All night, alright) 

(Oh yeah, this is gonna be good) 
18 & over, I wants 2 bone ya 
18 & over 

Electricity (Electricity) 
Plug it in if U dare, plug it in if U dare 
This motherfucker's so fast, it eats underwear 
So there, my little sweet sugar bear 
If that ain't enough 2 make U throw your hands in the air 
Then I'm all gone like the horns in this song (Oh oh oh oh!) 
Cuz I gots 2 keep U comin' till the early morn' 
And if U like that, then U can come back 
And if U don't - smack! And I'm out 

18 & over, I wants 2 bone ya 

When I blow that mind, baby (All night, alright) 
I'm gonna drive U crazy (All night, alright) 

18 & over, I wants 2 bone ya

"Until the end of time, I'll be there for you
You own my heart and mind I truly adore you
If God one day struck me blind, your beauty I'll still see
Love is too weak to define just what you mean to me

From the first moment I saw you, I knew you were the one
That night I had to call you, I was rappin' till the sun came up
Tellin' you just how fine you look in a word, you were sexy
All of my cool attitude you took my body was next

You made love to me, like you was afraid
Was you afraid of me? Was I the first?
Was I your every fantasy? That's why

Until the end of time, I'll be there for you
You own my heart and mind, I truly adore you
If God one day struck me blind, your beauty I'll still see
Love is too weak to define, just what you mean to me

When we be makin' love, I only hear the sounds
Heavenly angels cryin' up above tears of joy pourin' down on us
They know we need each other, they know you are my fix
I know, you know that I ain't cheatin' baby

They know this is serious, this ain't just for kicks, no
This condition I got is crucial, crucial
You could say that, I'm a terminal case
You could burn up my clothes, smash up my ride
Well maybe not the ride, but I got to have your face, all up in the place

I'd like to think that, I'm a man of exquisite taste
A hundred percent Italian silk, imported Egyptian lace
But nothin' baby, I said nothin' can compare
To your lovely face, do you know what I'm sayin' to you?

I'm just tryin' to say
That until, until the end of time
I'll be there for you

Can I talk to you? Tell you what you mean to me
Every time you wander, I'll be your eyes so you can see
I wanna show you things that I never showed no other, I wanna be
More than your mother, more than your brother

I wanna be like no other, if you need me, I'll never leave
I know, that you know, without you there is no me
There is no me, without you there is no sea there is no shore

Love is too weak to define how much I adore you
The last words you hear

Be with me darlin' till the end of all time
I'll give you my heart, I'll give you my mind
I'll give you my body, I'll give you my time
For all time, I am with you, you are with me"
The hell that got to do with Cream?
"One, two, one, two, three

I was working part time in a five and dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit too leisurely

Seems that I was busy doing something close too nothing
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door

She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

Built like she was, she had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm
So, look here, I put her on the back of my bike
And-a we went riding down by old man Johnson's farm

I said now, overcast days never turned me on
But something about the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't to bright, but I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks

She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star

Listen, they say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell ya, if I had the chance to do it all again
I wouldn't change a stroke 'cause baby I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then

Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
If it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I, think I, I think I love her

Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
If it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love"

"Tracy died soon after a long fought civil war
Just after I'd wiped away his last tear
I guess he's better off than he was before
A whole lot better off than the fools he left here

I used to cry for Tracy 'cause he was my only friend
Those kind of cars don't pass you every day
I used to cry for Tracy 'cause I wanted to see him again
But sometimes sometimes life ain't always the way

Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish that life is never ending
All good things, they say, never last

Springtime was always my favorite time of year
A time for lovers holding hands in the rain
Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears
Always cry for love, never cry for pain

He used to say so strong ""Oh I'm not afraid to die
I'm afraid of the death that left me hypnotized""
Now, staring at his picture I realize
No one could cry the way my Tracy cried

Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending
All good things, they say, never last

I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there
I know that he has found another friend
Maybe he's found the answer to all the April snow
Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again

Sometimes it snows in April
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending
But all good things, they say, never last
And all good things they say, never last
And love, just isn't love until it's passed"

With this one I don't even have to comb my hair
I can wear what I want to or nothing, she don't care
I don't even have to take her on the rollercoaster, see
'Cause this one, this one
She loves me 4 me

In the morning
When I rise and see her eyes
Look deep into mine
I find a better place

This one I can tell all my secrets to
I don't need to make her swear, she would never tell any who
Besides I'm the only one she ever wants to see
'Cause this one, honestly
She loves me 4 me

When the night falls
And she calls
I run to her side
'Cause she got the ride that I like to ride
I like to ride it

This one I can take over my momma's house
And I don't have to worry what goes in and out her mouth
All she needs is a little gratuity
She don't like no beef, she just loves me 4 me
She just loves me 4 me

This one, this one, ooh
She loves me 4 me"
"You can live your own life and I'll live mine
I will never try to keep you down
And even if I only see you some of the time
I'm just happy when you come around
And even if the sun don't shine

I'm warm enough when
You're in these arms of mine
Just as long as we're together
Every thing's alright, every thing's alright

There is nothing that will overcome the love we share
Nothing that will break us apart
Girl, I gotta always have you in my ear
Gotta always have you in my heart
Oh baby, your place or mine?
I'll get the music, baby, you bring the wine

Just as long as we're together
Oh girl, there's nothing better
Just as long as we're together
Every thing's alright, every thing's alright

Just as long as there is you
I'll be around doing what you what me to
Just as long as there is me
I'll be around to sing that melody, sugar

Just as long as we're together
Oh baby, every thing's alright
Just as long as we're together
Oh girl, every thing's alright
Just as long as we're together
Oh girl, every thing's alright

Don't u know there ain't better oh"
"Hot thing

Hot thing, barely 21
Hot thing, looking for big fun
Hot thing, what's your fantasy?
Hot thing, do you wanna play with me?

Hot thing, baby you dance so good
Hot thing, baby I knew you would
Hot thing, tell me what you see
Hot thing, when you smile, when you smile, when you smile
Are your smiles, are your smiles for me?

Hot thing, maybe you should give your folks a call
Hot thing, tell them you're goin' to the crystal ball
Hot thing, tell them you're comin' home late
If you're comin' home at all
Hot thing, tell them you found a brand new baby doll

Hot thing, I can't wait to get you home
Hot thing, where we could be alone
Hot thing, I could read you poetry
And then we could make a story of our own

Hot thing
Hot, hot, hot thing
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing, hot thing

Hot thing, barely 21
Hot thing, lookin' for big fun
Hot thing, what's your fantasy?
Hot thing, don't you wanna play with me?

Hot thing, I can't wait to get you home
Hot thing"
"Baby, baby, when I look at you
I get a warm feeling inside
There's something about the things you do
That keeps me satisfied

I wouldn't lie to you, baby
It's mainly a physical thing
This feeling that I got for you, baby
It makes me wanna sing

I feel for you, I think I love you
I feel for you, I think I love you

Baby, baby, when I lay wit' you
There's no place I'd rather be
I can't believe, can't believe it's true
The things that you do to me

I wouldn't lie to you, baby
I'm physically attracted to you
This feeling that I got for you, baby, ooh, baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do, for you girl

I feel for you, I think I love you
I feel for you, I think I love you

Play

I think it's love
I feel for you, I think it's love
I feel for you, I think I love you
I feel for you, I think it's love

Play

Baby, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh, oh no

I feel for you, I think I love you
I feel for you, I think I love you"
"This will be the day that you will hear me say
That I will never run away
I am here for you, love is meant for two
Now tell me what you're gonna do

If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you be a happy boy or a girl?
If I could I would give you the world
All I can do is just offer you my love

Which one of us is right if we always fight?
Why can't we just let love decide?
Am I the weaker man because I understand
That love must be the master plan?

If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you be a happy boy or a girl?
If I could I would give you the world
All I can do is just offer you my love

D to the I to the A to the M
O to the N to the D to the pearls of love
D to the I to the A to the M
O to the N to the D to the pearls of love

There will come a time, love will blow your mind
And everything you'll look for you'll find
That will be the time, that everything will shine
So bright it makes you colorblind

If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you be a happy boy or a girl?
If I could I would give you the world
But all I can do is just offer you my love

If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you be a happy boy or a girl?
If I could I would give you the world
All I can do is just offer you my love

If I gave you diamonds and pearls
Would you be, would you, would you be happy little baby?"
"Oh, ooh

Wherever u go, whatever u do
Oh, please, remember that I'll always be there for you
You don't have to call, you don't have to say
Just think about me and I'll be on my way

I don't have to worry, I'm sure you'll be fine
'Cuz if you stay happy, then what's your's is mine
Wherever u go, whatever u do
Remember that I'll always be there for you
Oh, baby

Wherever you are, think of your dreams
Oh, please, remember life ain't always what it seems
For each rainy day that comes your way
The sun will come shining and you'll be okay

Keep on smiling, every girl and boy
Remember when you were children you had toys
Wherever you are, think of your dreams
Remember that dreams become the life you lead

Whatever you play, it's okay to lose
Ooh, sometimes, long as you learn from every game you choose
If one thing is sure, you'll always endure
If you try your best at everything you do

Say what you mean and mean what you say
The price for a broken heart's to much to pay
And nothing is worth it, if you don't have to try
The higher the stakes, the higher the sky

Wherever u go, whatever u do
Please remember, remember that I'll always be there for you"

"Could you be
The most beautiful girl in the world
It's plain to see
You're the reason that God made a girl

When the day turns into the last day of all time
I can say, I hope you are in these arms of mine
And when the night falls before that day I will cry
I will cry tears of joy
'Cause after you all one can do is die

Could you be
The most beautiful girl in the world, could you be
It's plain to see
You're the reason that God made a girl
You're the reason that God made a girl
Oh yes, you are

How can I get through days when I can't get through hours
I can try but when I do I see you and I'm devoured, oh yes
Who'd allow, who'd allow a face to be soft as a flower
I could bow and feel proud in the light of this power, oh yes
  (Bow down)

Could you be
(Could you be)
The most beautiful girl in the world
Could you be
It's plain to see
You're the reason that God made a girl
Oh yes, you are

And if the stars ever fell one by one from the sky
I know Mars could not be too far behind
'Cuz baby, this kind of beauty has got no reason to ever be shy
'Cuz honey, this kind of beauty the kind that comes from inside

Could you be
(Could you be)
The most beautiful girl in the world
(So beautiful, beautiful )
It's plain to see
(Plain to see)
You're the reason that God made a girl, oh yeah
Oh yes, you are

Could you be"
"Every Friday night I call your butt up on the phone
A deeper voice answers and says you're not at home
Now if you think that I'm a fool who'll go for any line
Then honey, put down all your money, you win every time

Irresistible bitch, I love the way you walk
Irresistible bitch, I love the way you talk
Irresistible bitch and I really dig the way you kiss
Irresistible, oh mama, I wish I could resist

All my partners ask me why I take so much abuse
Why am I so faithful, honey? Why are you so loose?
They say why am I the one who never gets to take you home?
But they don't know the things you do to me when we're alone

Irresistible bitch, I love the way you walk
Irresistible bitch, I love the way you talk
Irresistible bitch, I really dig the way you kiss
Irresistible, oh mama, I wish I could resist
Hurt me, hurt me

Stole all my honey
Played it off like it was a joke
If stealing all my honey, baby, keep you by my side
Bleed me till I'm broke

Hell if I know why I let you drive my car
Don't I know that walkin' won't get me very far?
Sure, I know that cryin' over you is just in vain
But all the things I lose don't add up to all the things I gain

Irresistible bitch, I love the way you walk
Irresistible bitch, I love the way you talk
Irresistible bitch, I really dig the way you kiss, ain't it a shame?
Irresistible, mama, mama, I wish I could re
Hurt me

Stole all my honey
Played it off like it was a joke
Stealing all my honey, baby, keep you by my side
Bleed me till I'm broke

Everybody, everybody dance, everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody dance, everybody

Irresistible bitch
Irresistible bitch

Everybody, everybody dance, everybody
Irresistible bitch
Everybody, everybody dance, everybody"
"It was only last June
When her old man ran away
She couldn't stop cryin'
'Cause she knew he was gone to stay
10:35 on a lonely Friday night
She was standing by the bar
Hmm, she was looking alright, yea

I asked her if she
Wanted to dance?
An' she said that
All she wanted
Was a good man
An' wanted to know
If I thought I was qualified, yea

I said, ""Baby, don't waste your time
I know, what's on your mind
May be qualified
For a one night stand
But I could never take the place
Of your man""

It hurt me so bad, when she told me
With tears in her eyes
  (Tears in her eyes)
He was all she ever had
An' now she wanted to die
He left her with a baby
An' another one on the way, yea

She couldn't stop cryin'
'Cause she knew he was gone to stay, yea
She asked me, if we could be friends
An' I said, ""Oh, honey, baby
That's a dead end
You know 'n' I know
That we wouldn't be satisfied""
No, no

An' I said, ""Baby don't waste your time
I know what's on your mind
Wouldn't be satisfied
  (Wouldn't be satisfied)
With a one night stand
  (Oh, oh, oh)
An' I could never take the place
Of your man""
Yea, yea, the place of your man
(Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo)

One, two, one, two"
