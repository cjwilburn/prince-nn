"18 & over 

(Come) {repeat in song} 

CHORUS: 
18 & over, I wants 2 bone ya (Yeah, baby) 
18 & over (Oh yeah, this is gonna be good) 
18 & over, I wants 2 bone ya (Yeah, baby) 
18 & over (Oh yeah, this is gonna be good) 

Now wait a minute 
This ain't nothin' but a little funky mack song 
All I'm sayin' is that I wanna smack it all night long 
On and on until the early morn' 
Givin' up all U need so U can get your groove on 
And as long as I got your attention (Yeah) 
There's a couple of new positions that I'd like 2 mention 
Did U ever hear the one about the pinwheel? (No) 
That's the one where I put your legs behind your head 
And real dirty like, I'ma spin U around 
And grab U by the waist and pump U till I hear my baby say ""Oww!"" 
That's what I know U like 
I'm your nigga now and I'm about 2 read your rights 
And as sure as I'm a nasty boy (What?) 
My girl, U know U got the right 2 make plenty noise (Oh!) 
Cuz this is your night and I'ma do U real good 
Just like a Kemo Sabe, Bone Ranger should 
Come 

18 & over, I wants 2 bone ya 
18 & over (Oh yeah, this is gonna be good) 
Come 
18 & over, I wants 2 bone ya 
18 & over (Oh yeah, this is gonna be good) 

And er ah... 
That's what we layin' 4 in the 9 5 
As long we know it's safe, we ain't riskin' no lives (Yeah) 
My doctor's name is Feelgood, makin' it so I do 
And if your name is ""Healthy"" then it's cool if me and U 
Just come - yeah baby, U should do all that 
Come - yeah baby 

(Oh yeah, this is gonna be good) 
18 & over, I wants 2 bone ya 
18 & over 

Hi-yo Silver, it's the Bone Ranger, I'll freak U 2 the marrow 
With a little somethin' that I call the wheelbarrow 
Walkin' up on your hands while I straddle your thighs 
In goes the truth and out goes the lie 
And before the beach gets 2 sandy (Uh oh) 
We'll call a wet towel, W.C. - it's Handy 
And it's all nice, comin' one, comin' twice 
And if the Johnny's slippery, we'll have 2 take the trip 2 Electricity 
And check out the sights (Check out the sights) 
And check out the sights 

When I blow that mind, baby (All night, alright) 
I'm gonna drive U crazy (All night, alright) 

(Oh yeah, this is gonna be good) 
18 & over, I wants 2 bone ya 
18 & over 

Electricity (Electricity) 
Plug it in if U dare, plug it in if U dare 
This motherfucker's so fast, it eats underwear 
So there, my little sweet sugar bear 
If that ain't enough 2 make U throw your hands in the air 
Then I'm all gone like the horns in this song (Oh oh oh oh!) 
Cuz I gots 2 keep U comin' till the early morn' 
And if U like that, then U can come back 
And if U don't - smack! And I'm out 

18 & over, I wants 2 bone ya 

When I blow that mind, baby (All night, alright) 
I'm gonna drive U crazy (All night, alright) 

18 & over, I wants 2 bone ya 
18 & over (Oh yeah, this is gonna be good) 
18 & over, I wants 2 bone ya

"Until the end of time, I'll be there for you
You own my heart and mind I truly adore you
If God one day struck me blind, your beauty I'll still see
Love is too weak to define just what you mean to me

From the first moment I saw you, I knew you were the one
That night I had to call you, I was rappin' till the sun came up
Tellin' you just how fine you look in a word, you were sexy
All of my cool attitude you took my body was next

You made love to me, like you was afraid
Was you afraid of me? Was I the first?
Was I your every fantasy? That's why

Until the end of time, I'll be there for you
You own my heart and mind, I truly adore you
If God one day struck me blind, your beauty I'll still see
Love is too weak to define, just what you mean to me

When we be makin' love, I only hear the sounds
Heavenly angels cryin' up above tears of joy pourin' down on us
They know we need each other, they know you are my fix
I know, you know that I ain't cheatin' baby

They know this is serious, this ain't just for kicks, no
This condition I got is crucial, crucial
You could say that, I'm a terminal case
You could burn up my clothes, smash up my ride
Well maybe not the ride, but I got to have your face, all up in the place

I'd like to think that, I'm a man of exquisite taste
A hundred percent Italian silk, imported Egyptian lace
But nothin' baby, I said nothin' can compare
To your lovely face, do you know what I'm sayin' to you?

I'm just tryin' to say
That until, until the end of time
I'll be there for you

Can I talk to you? Tell you what you mean to me
Every time you wander, I'll be your eyes so you can see
I wanna show you things that I never showed no other, I wanna be
More than your mother, more than your brother

I wanna be like no other, if you need me, I'll never leave
I know, that you know, without you there is no me
There is no me, without you there is no sea there is no shore

Love is too weak to define how much I adore you
The last words you hear

Be with me darlin' till the end of all time
I'll give you my heart, I'll give you my mind
I'll give you my body, I'll give you my time
For all time, I am with you, you are with me",2017-07-19 17:07:58.722651
