Tracy died soon after a long fought civil war Just after I'd wiped away his last tear I guess he's better off than he was before A whole lot better off than the fools he left here  I used to cry for Tracy 'cause he was my only friend Those kind of cars don't pass you every day I used to cry for Tracy 'cause I wanted to see him again But sometimes sometimes life ain't always the way  Sometimes it snows in April Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad Sometimes I wish that life is never ending All good things, they say, never last  Springtime was always my favorite time of year A time for lovers holding hands in the rain Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears Always cry for love, never cry for pain  He used to say so strong "Oh I'm not afraid to die I'm afraid of the death that left me hypnotized" Now, staring at his picture I realize No one could cry the way my Tracy cried  Sometimes it snows in April Sometimes I feel so bad Sometimes I wish that life was never ending All good things, they say, never last  I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there I know that he has found another friend Maybe he's found the answer to all the April snow Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again  Sometimes it snows in April Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad Sometimes I wish that life was never ending But all good things, they say, never last And all good things they say, never last And love, just isn't love until it's passed

Tracy died soon after a long fought civil war Just after I'd wiped away his last tear I guess he's better off than he was before A whole lot better off than the fools he left here  I used to cry for Tracy 'cause he was my only friend Those kind of cars don't pass you every day I used to cry for Tracy 'cause I wanted to see him again But sometimes sometimes life ain't always the way  Sometimes it snows in April Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad Sometimes I wish that life is never ending All good things, they say, never last  Springtime was always my favorite time of year A time for lovers holding hands in the rain Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears Always cry for love, never cry for pain  He used to say so strong "Oh I'm not afraid to die I'm afraid of the death that left me hypnotized" Now, staring at his picture I realize No one could cry the way my Tracy cried  Sometimes it snows in April Sometimes I feel so bad Sometimes I wish that life was never ending All good things, they say, never last  I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there I know that he has found another friend Maybe he's found the answer to all the April snow Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again  Sometimes it snows in April Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad Sometimes I wish that life was never ending But all good things, they say, never last And all good things they say, never last And love, just isn't love until it's passed

Until the end of time, I'll be there for you You own my heart and mind I truly adore you If God one day struck me blind, your beauty I'll still see Love is too weak to define just what you mean to me  From the first moment I saw you, I knew you were the one That night I had to call you, I was rappin' till the sun came up Tellin' you just how fine you look in a word, you were sexy All of my cool attitude you took my body was next  You made love to me, like you was afraid Was you afraid of me? Was I the first? Was I your every fantasy? That's why  Until the end of time, I'll be there for you You own my heart and mind, I truly adore you If God one day struck me blind, your beauty I'll still see Love is too weak to define, just what you mean to me  When we be makin' love, I only hear the sounds Heavenly angels cryin' up above tears of joy pourin' down on us They know we need each other, they know you are my fix I know, you know that I ain't cheatin' baby  They know this is serious, this ain't just for kicks, no This condition I got is crucial, crucial You could say that, I'm a terminal case You could burn up my clothes, smash up my ride Well maybe not the ride, but I got to have your face, all up in the place  I'd like to think that, I'm a man of exquisite taste A hundred percent Italian silk, imported Egyptian lace But nothin' baby, I said nothin' can compare To your lovely face, do you know what I'm sayin' to you?

Tracy died soon after a long fought civil war Just after I'd wiped away his last tear I guess he's better off than he was before A whole lot better off than the fools he left here  I used to cry for Tracy 'cause he was my only friend Those kind of cars don't pass you every day I used to cry for Tracy 'cause I wanted to see him again But sometimes sometimes life ain't always the way  Sometimes it snows in April Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad Sometimes I wish that life is never ending All good things, they say, never last  Springtime was always my favorite time of year A time for lovers holding hands in the rain Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears Always cry for love, never cry for pain  He used to say so strong "Oh I'm not afraid to die I'm afraid of the death that left me hypnotized" Now, staring at his picture I realize No one could cry the way my Tracy cried  Sometimes it snows in April Sometimes I feel so bad Sometimes I wish that life was never ending All good things, they say, never last  I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there I know that he has found another friend Maybe he's found the answer to all the April snow Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again  Sometimes it snows in April Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad Sometimes I wish that life was never ending But all good things, they say, never last And all good things they say, never last And love, just isn't love until it's passed

Tracy died soon after a long fought civil war Just after I'd wiped away his last tear I guess he's better off than he was before A whole lot better off than the fools he left here  I used to cry for Tracy 'cause he was my only friend Those kind of cars don't pass you every day I used to cry for Tracy 'cause I wanted to see him again But sometimes sometimes life ain't always the way  Sometimes it snows in April Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad Sometimes I wish that life is never ending All good things, they say, never last  Springtime was always my favorite time of year A time for lovers holding hands in the rain Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears Always cry for love, never cry for pain  He used to say so strong "Oh I'm not afraid to die I'm afraid of the death that left me hypnotized" Now, staring at his picture I realize No one could cry the way my Tracy cried  Sometimes it snows in April Sometimes I feel so bad Sometimes I wish that life was never ending All good things, they say, never last  I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there I know that he has found another friend Maybe he's found the answer to all the April snow Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again  Sometimes it snows in April Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad Sometimes I wish that life was never ending But all good things, they say, never last And all good things they say, never last And love, just isn't love until it's passed

Until the end of time, I'll be there for you You own my heart and mind I truly adore you If God one day struck me blind, your beauty I'll still see Love is too weak to define just what you mean to me  From the first moment I saw you, I knew you were the one That night I had to call you, I was rappin' till the sun came up Tellin' you just how fine you look in a word, you were sexy All of my cool attitude you took my body was next  You made love to me, like you was afraid Was you afraid of me? Was I the first? Was I your every fantasy?

Tracy died soon after a long fought civil war Just after I'd wiped away his last tear I guess he's better off than he was before A whole lot better off than the fools he left here  I used to cry for Tracy 'cause he was my only friend Those kind of cars don't pass you every day I used to cry for Tracy 'cause I wanted to see him again But sometimes sometimes life ain't always the way  Sometimes it snows in April Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad Sometimes I wish that life is never ending All good things, they say, never last  Springtime was always my favorite time of year A time for lovers holding hands in the rain Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears Always cry for love, never cry for pain  He used to say so strong "Oh I'm not afraid to die I'm afraid of the death that left me hypnotized" Now, staring at his picture I realize No one could cry the way my Tracy cried  Sometimes it snows in April Sometimes I feel so bad Sometimes I wish that life was never ending All good things, they say, never last  I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there I know that he has found another friend Maybe he's found the answer to all the April snow Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again  Sometimes it snows in April Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad Sometimes I wish that life was never ending But all good things, they say, never last And all good things they say, never last And love, just isn't love until it's passed

Until the end of time, I'll be there for you You own my heart and mind I truly adore you If God one day struck me blind, your beauty I'll still see Love is too weak to define just what you mean to me  From the first moment I saw you, I knew you were the one That night I had to call you, I was rappin' till the sun came up Tellin' you just how fine you look in a word, you were sexy All of my cool attitude you took my body was next  You made love to me, like you was afraid Was you afraid of me? Was I the first? Was I your every fantasy? That's why  Until the end of time, I'll be there for you You own my heart and mind, I truly adore you If God one day struck me blind, your beauty I'll still see Love is too weak to define, just what you mean to me  When we be makin' love, I only hear the sounds Heavenly angels cryin' up above tears of joy pourin' down on us They know we need each other, they know you are my fix I know, you know that I ain't cheatin' baby  They know this is serious, this ain't just for kicks, no This condition I got is crucial, crucial You could say that, I'm a terminal case You could burn up my clothes, smash up my ride Well maybe not the ride, but I got to have your face, all up in the place  I'd like to think that, I'm a man of exquisite taste A hundred percent Italian silk, imported Egyptian lace But nothin' baby, I said nothin' can compare To your lovely face, do you know what I'm sayin' to you?

Tracy died soon after a long fought civil war Just after I'd wiped away his last tear I guess he's better off than he was before A whole lot better off than the fools he left here  I used to cry for Tracy 'cause he was my only friend Those kind of cars don't pass you every day I used to cry for Tracy 'cause I wanted to see him again But sometimes sometimes life ain't always the way  Sometimes it snows in April Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad Sometimes I wish that life is never ending All good things, they say, never last  Springtime was always my favorite time of year A time for lovers holding hands in the rain Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears Always cry for love, never cry for pain  He used to say so strong "Oh I'm not afraid to die I'm afraid of the death that left me hypnotized" Now, staring at his picture I realize No one could cry the way my Tracy cried  Sometimes it snows in April Sometimes I feel so bad Sometimes I wish that life was never ending All good things, they say, never last  I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there I know that he has found another friend Maybe he's found the answer to all the April snow Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again  Sometimes it snows in April Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad Sometimes I wish that life was never ending But all good things, they say, never last And all good things they say, never last And love, just isn't love until it's passed

Tracy died soon after a long fought civil war Just after I'd wiped away his last tear I guess he's better off than he was before A whole lot better off than the fools he left here  I used to cry for Tracy 'cause he was my only friend Those kind of cars don't pass you every day I used to cry for Tracy 'cause I wanted to see him again But sometimes sometimes life ain't always the way  Sometimes it snows in April Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad Sometimes I wish that life is never ending All good things, they say, never last  Springtime was always my favorite time of year A time for lovers holding hands in the rain Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears Always cry for love, never cry for pain  He used to say so strong "Oh I'm not afraid to die I'm afraid of the death that left me hypnotized" Now, staring at his picture I realize No one could cry the way my Tracy cried  Sometimes it snows in April Sometimes I feel so bad Sometimes I wish that life was never ending All good things, they say, never last  I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there I know that he has found another friend Maybe he's found the answer to all the April snow Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again  Sometimes it snows in April Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad Sometimes I wish that life was never ending But all good things, they say, never last And all good things they say, never last And love, just isn't love until it's passed
